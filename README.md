### About me

Regarding contacts with programming and the world of ICT, I took my first steps approximately 3 years ago, and in 2022 I was able to finish my degree as a Software Development Technologist at the Pascual Bravo University Institution in the city of Medell√≠n, as well as also finalize the TIC 2022 Mission program offered by the Ministry of Information and Communication Technologies, which aimed to train 100,000 Colombian youth and adults in programming. There I was able to acquire various knowledge in languages such as Python, C# and Java, creating basic projects, using object-oriented programming, projects with connection to databases using the graphical part, with the model view controller (MVC), among others.

I am currently part of an alliance between Globant and Cesde called dual training, where I continue to learn about this wonderful world.
